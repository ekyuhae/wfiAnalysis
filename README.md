# wfiAnalysis
Integrated analysis pipeline for HaiderLab's widefield calcium imaging system. 

consists four different experimental paradigm: 1) phasemapping (or retinotopic mapping), 2) barmapping, 3) passive experiment, and 4) behavioral experiment.

1) phasemapping (retiontopic mapping): drifting checkerboard stimulus is displayed on the screen to anesthetized mouse to get retinotopic gradient maps and visual field sign map in visual cortex. Adapted Anne Churchland lab's visual stimulus system scripts for the experiment and modified their analysis code. 
2) barmapping: similar to retinotopic mapping, but Haider lab's own visual stimulus system scripts are used. Discrete flashing bars with different contrast levels are shown in awake animal experiment for mapping receptive field in visual areas.  
3) passive experiment: Gabor grating visual stimulus in either binocular or monocular visual field is displayed to map the visual receptive field when the animal is passively viewing the stimuli. Control experiment for behavior task experiment.
4) behaviorTask Experiment: Gabor grating visual stimulus in either binocular or monocular visual field and the animal performs the spatial detection task.
